    <h3 class="page-title">Hello Hello!</h3>
    <p id="about">I'm Sree Harsha Mamilla and I generally create content for Android or The Web.</p>
    <p>And when I am not coding, I am either busy cheering for my favourite football team Arsenal or spending time with
        my camera.</p>

    <h3>Work</h3>
    <p>I'm currently looking for a job (** hint hint ** if you have an opportunity in mind for me, I would really
        appreciate if you reached out). In my most recent gig at VSP (VSP Vison Care), I worked as an
        Associate Software developer, where I helped build backend services and portals (mainly Java & Angular).</p>

    <p>And prior to VSP, I worked at D&B as a Java intern.</p>

    <p>Thanks for stopping by - @mavharsha</p>
